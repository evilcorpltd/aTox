aTox is a free open-source messaging app for the Tox protocol.

<b>Why aTox?</b>
* Open-source: free to share, inspect, and change as you like.
* Reasonable: sane defaults, no guesses about what you care about, doesn't ignore what <b>you</b> want.
* End-to-end encrypted: the only people who can see your conversations are the people you're talking to.
* Distributed: no central servers that can be taken down or compelled to turn over data.
* Lightweight: no telemetry, ads, or other forms of monitoring.
